{"type": "Earthquake", "desc1": "Earthquakes can strike without warning, making preparation essential—especially for people living in high-risk areas such as countries along the Pacific Ring of Fire (including Japan, Indonesia, Chile, Mexico, and the U.S. West Coast), parts of South Asia, Turkey, Iran, and regions near major fault lines like the Himalayas and the Alpide Belt. If you live in or travel through these zones, secure heavy furniture, store fragile items on low shelves, and keep an emergency kit with water, food, flashlights, batteries, and first aid supplies. Establish a family communication plan and learn how to shut off your utilities safely.", "desc2": "When shaking begins, remember to Drop, Cover, and Hold On: drop to the ground, take cover under sturdy furniture, and hold on until the movement stops. Indoors, stay put to avoid falling debris; outdoors, move away from buildings, power lines, and trees. After the shaking stops, expect aftershocks, check for injuries, and avoid damaged structures or areas with gas leaks. Use battery-powered radios or phones to get official updates, and follow emergency instructions from local authorities, especially in regions where strong aftershocks and infrastructure damage are common.", "advicePoints": ["Drop, Cover, and Hold On — drop to your hands and knees, take cover under sturdy furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.", "Stay indoors if you’re already inside — running outside during shaking increases the risk of injury from falling debris.", "Stay away from windows, mirrors, and glass to avoid shattering hazards.", "Protect your head and neck with your arms or a cushion if no shelter is nearby.", "If you’re outside, move to an open area away from buildings, streetlights, trees, and power lines."], "riskFactors": ["Living near major fault lines — regions like the Pacific Ring of Fire or the Alpide Belt experience frequent seismic activity.", "Weak or poorly constructed buildings — older structures or those not built to seismic standards are more likely to collapse.", "Soft or unstable ground conditions — areas prone to liquefaction or landslides can amplify damage during a quake."], "usefulLinks": ["https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes", "https://earthquake.usgs.gov", "https://www.ifrc.org/disaster-preparedness"], "img1": "images/placeholder.jpg", "img2": "images/placeholder.jpg", "videoLink": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahotOBqUoKI"}
