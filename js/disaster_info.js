const tsunami = new Disaster("tsunami", "Tsunami", "Tsunamis are powerful, fast-moving ocean waves most often triggered by large undersea earthquakes, though landslides, volcanic eruptions, and even meteor impacts can also generate them. When the seafloor suddenly shifts, it displaces massive amounts of water, sending waves radiating outward in all directions. In the deep ocean these waves can travel at jet-like speeds—sometimes over 500 miles (800 kilometers) per hour—while appearing only a few feet high. It’s only when they approach shallow coastal waters that they slow down, grow dramatically in height, and become capable of widespread destruction.", "These destructive waves are most common around the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” a zone known for intense tectonic activity. Countries such as Japan, Indonesia, Chile, and the Philippines experience frequent earthquakes and therefore face some of the highest tsunami risks. Indonesia, for example, sits at the convergence of multiple tectonic plates, making it one of the world’s most tsunami-prone regions. The Indian Ocean, though less active overall, has also produced devastating tsunamis, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Coastal areas along subduction zones—where one tectonic plate dives beneath another—are especially susceptible because these regions are prone to the kinds of massive undersea earthquakes that can generate tsunamis.", ["Move to high ground immediately if you feel a strong coastal earthquake—don’t wait for an official warning.", "Know your evacuation routes ahead of time and practice them with your family.", "Stay away from the shoreline during warnings; incoming waves can be unpredictable and fast.", "Prepare an emergency kit with essentials such as water, food, medications, and a radio.", "Wait for official “all clear” messages before returning, as multiple waves can strike hours apart."], ["Living in low-lying coastal areas: Communities close to the shoreline or at sea level are highly vulnerable to flooding and strong currents.", "Proximity to tectonic plate boundaries: Regions near subduction zones—such as around the Pacific Ring of Fire—face higher chances of tsunami-generating earthquakes.", "Lack of early-warning systems or preparedness: Limited evacuation routes, poor communication networks, or low public awareness increases the risk of casualties and damage."], ["https://tsunami.ioc.unesco.org/en/what-do", "https://tsunami.ioc.unesco.org/en/tsunami-ready", "https://www.cdc.gov/natural-disasters/psa-toolkit/prepare-for-tsunami.html"], "images/tsunami2.jpg", "images/tsunami3.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EDflnGzjTY?si=Wh9OkEMu9pwX24HQ");

const flood = new Disaster("flood", "Flood", "Floods are among the most widespread and frequent natural hazards, occurring when water overflows onto land that is normally dry. They can result from heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, storm surges during coastal storms, or the failure of dams and levees. Depending on their cause, floods can develop slowly over several days or strike suddenly with little or no warning, as seen in flash floods. These rapid events are especially dangerous because the fast-moving water can sweep away vehicles, erode land, and cause significant damage to homes and infrastructure.", "Floods are most common in regions with heavy seasonal rains, large river systems, and low-lying terrain. For example, South and Southeast Asia experience frequent and severe flooding during monsoon seasons, affecting countries such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Thailand. Bangladesh, located on the world’s largest river delta, is one of the most flood-prone countries due to its flat landscape and the convergence of major rivers like the Ganges and Brahmaputra. In the United States, areas along the Mississippi River and parts of the Gulf Coast are highly susceptible to river and coastal flooding. Meanwhile, countries in Africa’s Sahel region often face flash floods triggered by sudden intense rainfall on dry, compacted soil. Coastal regions worldwide—including parts of the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands—are also at high risk of flooding from tropical cyclones and rising sea levels.", ["Move to higher ground immediately if water begins to rise or an evacuation order is issued.", "Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters, as even shallow water can be dangerous.", "Prepare an emergency kit with water, food, medications, and important documents.", "Stay informed via local alerts, weather reports, and official instructions.", "Protect your home in advance by clearing drains, elevating electrical systems, and installing flood barriers if possible"], ["Living in low-lying or coastal areas: Communities near rivers, lakes, or the coast are more vulnerable to overflowing water and storm surges.", "Heavy seasonal rainfall or snowmelt: Regions with intense monsoons, hurricanes, or rapid snowmelt are at higher risk of sudden or prolonged flooding.", "Poor drainage and urban development: Cities with inadequate drainage systems or extensive paved surfaces experience faster water accumulation and flash floods."], ["https://www.un-spider.org/projects/floodguide", "https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/en/expertise/water/international-handbook-on-emergency-management-for-flood-defences", "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/flood-safety-tips"], "images/flood2.jpg", "images/flood3.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCsvOWurn4M?si=XOF49CUTiYRRmaUa");

They can ignite naturally, often from lightning strikes, or as a result of human activities such as campfires, discarded cigarettes, and agricultural burning. Once ignited, wildfires can spread rapidly due to dry conditions, strong winds, and flammable vegetation, consuming everything in their path. They produce large amounts of smoke, which can affect air quality and pose respiratory risks even far from the fire itself. In addition to immediate dangers to life and property, wildfires can have long-term environmental impacts, including soil degradation, loss of wildlife habitat, and changes to local ecosystems.", "Wildfires are most common in regions with hot, dry climates and extended periods of drought. For example, the western United States, particularly California, experiences frequent and severe wildfires due to its Mediterranean climate and dense vegetation. Australia is another hotspot, with bushfires often occurring during the hot, dry summer months. Mediterranean regions in southern Europe, including Spain, Portugal, and Greece, also face a high risk of wildfires. Other areas prone to wildfires include parts of Canada, South America, and Africa, especially where seasonal dry conditions coincide with flammable vegetation. Climate change has intensified wildfire risks globally by increasing the frequency and severity of heatwaves and droughts in many regions.", ["Stay informed: Monitor local news, fire alerts, and weather conditions to know when wildfires are nearby or likely.", "Create a defensible space around your home: Clear dry vegetation, leaves, and flammable materials at least 30 feet from buildings to reduce fire risk.", "Prepare an emergency kit and evacuation plan: Include water, food, medications, important documents, masks for smoke, and a plan for pets and family members.", "Evacuate immediately when advised: Do not wait for the fire to reach you—wildfires can spread rapidly and unpredictably.", "Protect yourself during fire and smoke exposure: Stay indoors if safe, use N95 masks to filter smoke, keep windows and doors closed, and avoid outdoor activity during heavy smoke."], ["Dry, hot, and windy conditions: Regions experiencing prolonged droughts, high temperatures, and strong winds are much more susceptible to wildfires.", "Abundant flammable vegetation: Areas with dense forests, grasslands, or brush provide fuel that allows fires to spread quickly.", "Human activity: Campfires, discarded cigarettes, fireworks, and uncontrolled agricultural burning significantly increase the likelihood of wildfire ignition."], ["https://www.cdc.gov/wildfires/safety/index.html", "https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.htm", "https://www.ready.gov/wildfires"], "images/wildfire2.jpg", "images/wildfire3.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0Q8B9K79Q8?si=Zm6odjAaX62RPEKv");

Unlike natural disasters, these emergencies are driven by human activity—such as bombings, artillery attacks, armed clashes, and sieges—that can destroy homes, schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure. Civilians are often forced to flee, resulting in mass displacement, overcrowded refugee camps, and shortages of food, clean water, and medical care. The impact is compounded by the breakdown of governance and emergency services, leaving affected populations highly vulnerable to secondary crises such as disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and psychological trauma.", "Warzone disasters are most common in regions experiencing prolonged armed conflict, political instability, or civil war. Currently, areas such as parts of Syria, Yemen, and Ukraine face severe humanitarian crises due to ongoing hostilities. Sub-Saharan Africa also has multiple hotspots, including regions of the Sahel, where conflicts in countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and South Sudan have caused large-scale displacement and food insecurity. In addition, parts of the Middle East—including Iraq and Afghanistan—have experienced repeated episodes of conflict that devastate communities and limit recovery. These regions are particularly vulnerable because prolonged fighting not only destroys infrastructure but also hinders the delivery of humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts.", ["Stay informed: Follow reliable news sources, official alerts, and humanitarian organization updates to understand risks and safe routes.", "Have an emergency plan: Identify safe locations, evacuation routes, and meeting points for family members in case of sudden attacks.", "Keep essential supplies ready: Include water, non-perishable food, medications, important documents, first-aid kits, and communication devices.", "Seek shelter immediately during attacks: Use reinforced buildings, basements, or designated safe zones, and avoid open areas.", "Avoid conflict zones whenever possible: Limit travel through high-risk areas, and coordinate with local authorities or humanitarian organizations if evacuation is needed."], ["Proximity to conflict zones: Living near areas of active fighting, shelling, or military operations greatly increases the risk of injury, displacement, or death.", "Weak infrastructure and governance: Regions with poor governance, limited emergency services, and damaged infrastructure are less able to protect civilians and respond to crises.", "High population density in conflict areas: Crowded urban centers or refugee camps are more vulnerable to collateral damage, shortages of food and water, disease outbreaks, and rapid spread of violence."], ["https://civiliansinconflict.org/tools/toolkit-advancing-protection-of-civilians-in-conflict/", "https://globalprotectioncluster.org/themes/protection_civilians", "https://www.icrc.org/en/law-and-policy/protected-persons-civilians"], "images/activeWarzone2.jpg", "images/activeWarzone3.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/if99L1Oq-5w?si=NP837fKQh4QD0OMW");

These disasters can involve explosions, chemical leaks, fires, or structural collapses, often causing immediate injury, loss of life, and long-term environmental damage. Beyond the immediate impact, industrial accidents can contaminate air, water, and soil, disrupt local communities, and overwhelm emergency response systems. Unlike natural disasters, industrial accidents are largely preventable, but when safety protocols fail, the consequences can be catastrophic.", "Industrial accidents are most common in regions with high concentrations of heavy industry, chemical production, and energy facilities. For instance, countries such as China, India, and the United States have experienced frequent industrial accidents due to rapid industrialization, high production volumes, and sometimes insufficient enforcement of safety regulations. Major industrial hubs in Europe, such as the Ruhr area in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe, also face risks associated with chemical plants and manufacturing facilities. Developing nations, where safety standards may be lower or infrastructure aging, are particularly vulnerable to large-scale industrial incidents. Ports, refineries, and densely populated industrial zones further increase the potential impact of such disasters.", ["Know the hazards in your area: Identify nearby industrial facilities, chemicals in use, and potential risks such as explosions, toxic leaks, or fires.", "Have an emergency plan and kit: Include water, food, first-aid supplies, protective masks, important documents, and a plan for evacuation or shelter-in-place.", "Follow safety instructions and alerts: Pay attention to alarms, sirens, and official warnings from local authorities or facility management.", "Evacuate or shelter-in-place as advised: Move quickly to designated safe zones or follow sheltering procedures to minimize exposure to hazardous substances.", "Report hazards and stay informed: Notify authorities about unsafe conditions, chemical spills, or equipment malfunctions, and monitor updates from local emergency services."], ["Proximity to industrial facilities: Living or working near factories, chemical plants, refineries, or heavy manufacturing sites increases exposure to potential accidents.", "Poor safety standards or regulatory enforcement: Facilities with outdated equipment, insufficient maintenance, or weak safety protocols are more prone to accidents.", "Handling of hazardous materials: Use, storage, or transport of flammable, toxic, or explosive substances significantly raises the risk of fires, leaks, or explosions."], ["https://www.ready.gov/hazmat", "https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/chemical-accident-prevention-preparedness-and-response.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/natural-disasters/safety/guidelines-for-protecting-yourself-from-chemicals-after-a-disaster.html"], "images/industrialAccident2.jpeg", "images/industrialaccident3.jpeg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/D9LTTX1c2mQ?si=Z2pWWg74UH_X0CqT");

These emergencies include pandemics, outbreaks of infectious diseases, bioterrorism, contamination of food or water supplies, and mass casualty incidents. Unlike localized accidents, public health disasters can spread quickly and affect large populations, leading to illness, death, social disruption, and economic consequences. Rapid detection, containment, and response are critical to minimizing harm, alongside public communication, vaccination campaigns, and coordinated medical care.", "Public health emergencies are most common in regions where population density is high, healthcare infrastructure is limited, or environmental and social conditions favor disease transmission. For example, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as cholera, Ebola, and measles have frequently occurred in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare services may be limited. Urban centers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are particularly vulnerable to pandemics due to crowded living conditions, high mobility, and global connectivity. Additionally, countries with extensive agricultural or livestock industries can experience zoonotic disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza, which have the potential to spread rapidly among humans.

These storms form over warm ocean waters, typically between 5° and 20° latitude from the equator, where sea surface temperatures provide the energy needed for their development. As hurricanes or typhoons move toward land, they can cause widespread flooding, wind damage to buildings and infrastructure, and erosion of coastlines. In addition to physical destruction, these storms often disrupt electricity, transportation, and water supply systems, creating secondary hazards such as waterborne disease outbreaks and long-term economic losses.", "Hurricanes and typhoons are most common in tropical and subtropical regions, but the terminology differs by location: storms in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific are called hurricanes, while those in the Northwest Pacific are called typhoons. The Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and southeastern United States frequently experience hurricanes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season from June to November. Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and coastal areas of China, is prone to typhoons, especially between July and October. The Indian Ocean region, including India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, also faces tropical cyclones that produce storm surges and flooding in densely populated coastal areas. Islands in the Pacific and Caribbean are particularly vulnerable due to their small land area, high exposure to storm surges, and limited evacuation routes.", ["Stay informed: Monitor weather forecasts, alerts, and official warnings from meteorological agencies.", "Prepare an emergency kit: Include water, non-perishable food, medications, important documents, flashlights, batteries, and a first-aid kit.", "Secure your home: Reinforce windows and doors, bring outdoor furniture indoors, and clear drains to reduce flooding risk.", "Have an evacuation plan: Know safe routes, nearby shelters, and transportation options in case evacuation orders are issued.", "Follow official instructions: Evacuate immediately if advised, avoid floodwaters, and stay away from downed power lines or debris during and after the storm."], ["Coastal location: Living near the coast increases exposure to storm surges, high winds, and flooding.", "Poor infrastructure or weak building standards: Areas with unreinforced buildings, inadequate drainage, or weak levees are more vulnerable to damage.", "High population density: Crowded cities and towns amplify the impact of flooding, complicate evacuations, and increase potential casualties."], ["https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/weather/tropical-cyclones", "https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/index.html", "https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes"], "images/hurricane2.jpg", "images/hurricane3.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iv5mTnM7ww?si=2EoGNzpjOuq94uih");
